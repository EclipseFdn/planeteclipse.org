# have any of the following options:
#
# name: Name of the feed (defaults to the title found in the feed)
# offset: Number of hours (+ or -) the feed's times tend to be out
#
# Additionally any other option placed here will be available in
# the template (prefixed with channel_ for the Items loop).  We use
# this trick to make the faces work -- this isn't something Planet
# "natively" knows about.  Look at eclipse/index.html.tmpl
# for the flip-side of this.
