	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>Last year, when Eclipse 3.1 was released, we added our own mirror server with a dedicated 100 Mbps Internet connection to ease the bandwidth problems we were having. At the time, <a href="http://www.eclipsezone.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=91847710%E3%98%9F">Ed Burnette and many others could only guess</a> as to how much it costs to enable this, and this year we're adding 240 Mbps of bandwidth to our regular connection.  So how much does it cost?<br />
<br />Two words: <span>a lot</span>.  Each 100 Mbps connection requires one firewall and one switch port, and each connection is doubled up through two routers for failover (don't underestimate the monthly costs of using expensive Cisco router ports). Then there's bandwidth. Although we get volume discounts on bandwidth usage (the more we use, the cheaper each Mbps is) it adds up really fast when you're sustaining 150+ Mbps.<br />
<br />In other words, Callisto won't be free.  But it will be free for you and I, and thanks goes to the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/membership/">Eclipse Foundation members</a>. This<span> is a good example of how their membership dues are used to help support the projects.<br />

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/callisto/">Callisto</a> is approaching fast, and we received our new 100 Mbps network connections last week. To survive the Big Event, we'll be removing the 60 Mbps cap on our existing 100 Mbps and use these two 100 Mbps connections dedicated to downloads.  The net sum of usable bandwidth should be about 280 Mbps, routed through three different Cisco 7200 routers for maximum performance/failover.<br />
<br />On the server side, the eclipse.org cluster will handle the usual web pages, CVS, e-mail and RSYNC using its beefed up connection, while downloads will be redirected to the two dedicated 100 Mbps connections, served by an IBM eSeries P5 550 server with 16 GB of RAM.  We managed to get 3,500 simultaneous web connections to this IBM server alone, with plenty of room to spare.  All tolled, we successfully tested our infrastructure to support 11,000 concurrent web connections, and if need be, we can balloon to 15,000 (our daily average usually floats between 400 and 800.)<br />
<br />All this new bandwidth isn't available to us -- yet. We still need to do some testing first.  Sometime next week we'll host a "Mirror Site Appreciation Day" where, for the duration of a day, eclipse.org will attempt to host *all* its download traffic. The idea here is to load our systems with massive amounts of traffic to test our server performance and routing setup. Stay tuned...</div>		</p>

		<p>
<div>With Eclipse 3.2 a new JFace API is released addressing decorated fields. Everyone knows the little yellow light bulb that comes up if you want to create a new Java type and do not specify any package name.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4563/2287/1600/newtype.jpg">
<img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4563/2287/320/newtype.jpg" />
</a>
<br />Also a content assistant is provide that helps you choosing a package name. In Eclipse 3.2 this is now API and developers can use the feature to improve the user experience, especially in the area of validating user input.<br />
<br />I have put some sample code together that simply creates a decorated text field with a message. The user should provide a name. The name must not start with a blank though. In case it does, I show a little error sign that is augmented with a message.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4563/2287/1600/error.1.jpg">
<img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4563/2287/320/error.1.jpg" />
</a>
<br />If the user presses F1 in the field a content assitant pops up and proposes funny old german names that even google does not know :)<br />

</span>
<br />The code above really just covers a simple implementation. There is much more behind the concept of decorated fields and much more flexibility. I am planing on writing a more in detail article or HOWTO about decorated fields.</div>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>EclipseMonkey uses declarations in comments to specify when a script runs. The various triggers include menu selection, hot keys and now the pub/sub event handling that java calls "listening".<br />
<br />Say we had a script with metadata something like this:<br />
<blockquote>
<span>/*<br />* Listener: workspace().addResourceChangeListener(this)<br />&gt;*<br />&gt;*<br />*/<br />
</span>
</blockquote>The metadata processing finds two names in this mock expression: a script function name and a java method name. The rest is syntactic sugar to remind us how these names are used, which will be best understood by continuing our example. The declaration above presumes our script has two functions:<br />
<blockquote>
<span>function workspace () {<br />return Packages.org.eclipse.core.resources.ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace();<br />&gt;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;}<br />
<br />function resourceChanged (event) {<br />&gt;countOfChanges++;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;countOfChanges++;<br />}</span>
<br />
</blockquote>The first function provides the publishing object while the second function handles the updates it publishes. In this example it just counts updates but it could do more with the event that is passed along.<br />
<br />How does this work? EclipseMonkey uses reflection to find out what kind of object the listener expects and makes a proxy that will substitute. The proxy forwards messages to the script when it can find a function of the same name and ignores the rest. The monkey keeps the subscriptions current while we move or edit scripts. Thank you monkey.<br />
<br />(And thank you Wayne Beaton, who pair-programmed the proxy sample code into the subscription abstraction that makes all this work. Wayne, come back soon.)<br />
<br />You will find this capability in the version 0.1.8 of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dash/monkey-help.php?key=installing">EclipseMonkey</a>. Eclipse reports a lot of activity through listeners and now the monkey's listening.</div>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>Why is the Callisto Simultaneous Release named "Callisto" and not "Eclipse 3.2"? It's an excellent question and it has a good two-part answer.<br />
<br />(Part One) The Eclipse version numbers (X.Y.Z) have semantic meaning. X increments for breaking API changes; Y increments for non-breaking API changes; Z increments for bug fixes. The projects have different version numbers today, e.g., Platform 3.2, TPTP 4.2, BIRT 2.1, CDT 3.1, EMF 2.2, etc. If we forced everyone to a common version number (3.2) then some projects would move backwards (TPTP) and some would leap forward with no breaking API change (BIRT, EMF) and so on. We didn't want to force projects into naming conventions that broke the semantics and thus we didn't want to use a common number.<br />
<br />(Part Two) Different Eclipse projects have different release cycles. Some projects release once a year (e.g., Platform). Some release twice a year (e.g., TPTP, BIRT). Some release even more than that. By forcing the projects into a standard numbering, we would be limiting these faster releasing projects to the slowest project's schedule. That also did not seem correct.<br />
<br />Hence we left each project's version numbering alone, and we chose a word-based scheme (moons of Jupiter) to generate names for the simultaneous releases. This year it is <span>Callisto</span>, next year it will be <span>Europa</span>.</div>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>It was just last February that I took a deep breath and chugged back a glass of Steve Jobs kool-aid and despite some initial hiccups with the hardware it's been bliss ever since.  For the most part, that is.  While the Powerbook user experience was fantastic the performance of Eclipse on OS X was a mixed bag.  When compared with the ThinkPad I had been doing my Eclipse development on up until that point the build speed was better but the UI responsiveness was painful.  I would control-click on an item and wait seconds for a context menu to appear.  It would occasionally take so long that I would think that I had failed to click the button at all.  So for almost a year I alternated between love and rage when using Eclipse on OS X.  This state changed somewhat just after this past Christmas, however, as I had to once again do some work on Windows.  When faced with development on OS X after a session on my smoking fast Windows machine I cringed.  On windows things just "popped".  Even the improved build speed that I had felt when I upgraded to the Powerbook was shattered.  Suddenly my feelings toward Eclipse Mac development had soured.<br />
<br />When the MacBooks were announced I was excited.  Surely the performance numbers being touted in relation to it's predecessor would translate into big gains for Eclipse.  But I was hesitant.  No, that isn't right at all.  I just couldn't bring myself to buy my third laptop in as many years.<br />
<br />All that changed last week.  In a moment of weakness I ordered myself a MacBook.  It's been sitting on my lap now for several days and I've just now had a chance to really see how Eclipse behaves on it.<br />
<br />&gt;Wow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wow.<br />
<br />It's... perky.  Things happen!  There is no waiting!  Excited by my initial impression I went and downloaded the full Callisto release and proceeded to pull down the platform-ui source and test modules from CVS.  With my Powerbook I would pull down a fresh source tree and then go off to the coffee room.  Building from a clean state took a good 7-10 minutes and sitting around watching it was simply too painful.  A refreshing caffeinated beverage and perhaps a trip to the loo later I would return to find that it had finished its work.<br />
<br />On the Macbook this same operation took roughly a minute.  I think I may be drinking less coffee in the future.<br />
<br />I'm going to set up the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.test.performance/doc/Performance%20Tests%20HowTo.html">performance tests</a> next week and run them on the Macbook and Powerbook to see how they compare.  If I were a gambler I'd say the Powerbook is going to be spanked thoroughly.</div>		</p>

<div>One of the things that's great about open source is the interaction that you have with the community. I've worked on both closed and open source systems and let me tell you, open source is just way more fun.  There is no substitute for the level of interaction, quick turn around and raw power in working this way. Give me a guy ranting at me over some processed, filtered and predigested bug list any day!<br />
<br />We helped this guy out yesterday with a <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=145662">bizarre problem </a>that didn't happen on my machine.

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<p>Some days ago someone asked me if there are BitTorrent downloads for Eclipse. <em>Yes there are!</em> And it&#8217;s so easy. <img src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  In fact, I often use BitTorrent because the downloads are more reliable and the speed is better.<a id="more-92"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Install BitTorrent Client</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you need is a BitTorrent Client. I use <a title="Azureus BitTorrent Client" target="_blank" href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus </a>because it&#8217;s Java and based on Eclipse technology.  <img src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" class="wp-smiley" />  So <a title="Download Azureus" target="_blank" href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/download.php">download</a> Azureus for your platform. It comes with a nice installer. Just executed the downloaded file to start the Azureus Setup.</p>
<p>The Azureus Setup is very simple. It offers to start Azureus after successful installation. I suggest to do this because upon the first start of Azureus it opens a nice wizard, which guides you quickly through the configuration. Once this is done you can close Azureus again.</p>
<p><strong>2. Start Downloading</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <a target="_blank" title="Eclipse Downloads" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse Downloads</a> page.</p>
<p><a title="Download Eclipse Torrents Link" class="imagelink" href="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/download-torrents-link.png"><img alt="Download Eclipse Torrents Link" id="image93" title="Download Eclipse Torrents Link" src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/download-torrents-link.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>
<p>Click on the link &#8220;[torrents]&#8221; which will bring you right to the torrents. The torrents are created for every release and hosted at ibiblio.org.</p>
<p><a title="Eclipse Torrents at ibiblio.org" class="imagelink" href="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/ibiblio-page.png"><img alt="Eclipse Torrents at ibiblio.org" id="image94" title="Eclipse Torrents at ibiblio.org" src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/ibiblio-page.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Download Torrent" class="imagelink" href="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/ibiblio-torrent-download.png"><img alt="Download Torrent" id="image95" title="Download Torrent" src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/ibiblio-torrent-download.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>
<p>After you click on the Download torrent link you browser offers you to save or to open the torrent directly. Azureus associated itself with torrents files upon this. So the only thing I had to do is open the torrent directly and Azureus came up with this nice dialog.</p>
<p><a title="Open Torrent" class="imagelink" href="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/azureus-open-torrent.png"><img alt="Open Torrent" id="image96" title="Open Torrent" src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/azureus-open-torrent.thumbnail.png" /></a></p>
<p>There you can select the destination and the download will start after you click on OK.</p>
<p><a title="Downloading the Torrent" class="imagelink" href="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/torrent-downloading.png"><img alt="Downloading the Torrent" id="image97" src="http://wagenknecht.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/torrent-downloading.thumbnail.png" /></a>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>When the Eclipse Planning Council first announced that the ten projects were going to do a simultaneous release, almost all the projects wanted to be involved. The PR value in being part of Callisto was pre-destined to be enormous and everyone wanted to be part of it. On the flip-side, nobody wanted to take time away from their own project to test other projects - after all, each project's schedule was already tight.<br />
<br />Eclipse projects are, by-and-large, fairly high quality because the project teams take the time to test their APIs and their code. But without someone stepping up to the challenge of testing the in-betweens, the Callisto Simultaneous Release was/is bound to uncover bugs in the in-betweens: bugs that do not appear when project X is loaded by itself or project Y is loaded by itself, but do appear when both project X and project Y are active at the same time (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=146163">bug 146163 </a>is a simple example).<br />
<br />Our somewhat lame solution this year was to provide the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/callisto-files/callisto-bug-contest.php">Callisto Bug Contest</a> to encourage cross-project testing. The contest has been a partial success, finding bugs that might otherwise have been missed, but we'll need a less haphazard, more complete story for Europa (next year's simultaneous release)...</div>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<p>This week I was invited by the <a href="http://www.radrails.org">RadRails</a> guys on <a href="irc://freenode/radrails">#radrails</a> to join their team as a committer and I've gladly accepted.  Thanks guys!  RadRails is a relatively new IDE for the relatively new <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> web platform.  RadRails is Java software built on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> Rich Client Platform (RCP).</p>

<p>I have a stakeholder interest in RadRails because I use it for my Ruby on Rails development.  I like that it works on both Windows and my Mac and has nice Subversion integration, among other things.  The fact that I'm already really familiar with Eclipse doesn't hurt either.  I'm pretty pleased with RadRails but I wanted to see if I could help improve its quality and stability.</p>

<p>The invitation to be a committer was given after I submitted some <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> scripts to build RadRails.  I gained a lot of familiarity with RCP proejct structure and Ant while working on <a href="http://www.ryanlowe.ca/blog/sourceforge.net/projects/durham">Durham/AudioMan</a> and subsequent Eclipse Rich Client Platform projects.  Since the Durham Ant scripts were under the EPL, I just moved them over to RadRails with some changes.</p>

<p>The Ant scripts could be used by developers but mainly they will be used by a build machine to automate the build process.  Automating the build process is important because it removes a lot of the human error that happens with 'manual' building of packages and it introduces consistency in the build process, both of which ultimately improve the quality of the final product.  Build scripts also ensure that you can go back and built something three versions ago and it'll work just like the original.</p>

<p>When this is all in place I'll be one happy Software Engineer (B.Eng).</p>

<p>What else am I up to? I'm still working on <a href="http://www.fanconcert.com">fanconcert</a> and looking for full time work in either <b>Java+Eclipse+RCP</b> or <b>Ruby+Rails+DHTML</b>.  If you know of any opportunities in those two areas, especially in Ottawa, you can give me a shout: <b>blog(at)ryanlowe(dot)ca</b>.</p>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>The Callisto Simultaneous Release started with the goal of simultaneous releasing ten separate Eclipse projects. Just that. Nothing more. A same day, same hour release of ten separate projects. The project teams also had the sub-goal of solving the worst UI problems: those "three menu items with the same name" and "loading project X causes project Y to stop working"-type issues that cause severe embarrasment.<br />
<br />Although <span>simultaneous release</span> is what the projects said, the Eclipse community heard <span>integrated product</span>. That's a valid desire, but a much harder problem - we'll probably attempt that in one of our future yearly moon-of-Jupiter simultaneous releases. Until then, those of us on the technical side have been carefully trying to reset expectations to reality: a simultaneous release of ten projects.<br />
<br />Our lesson here is to be careful what one says because people will repeat what they want to hear, not what was actually said. Consider this non-Eclipse example:<br />
<ol>   <li>news.scotsman.com posts <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=759642006">an article</a> saying that pirated "Davinci Code" DVDs were low quality and that the pirates promised a better rip soon.</li>   <li>slashdot.org readers were among the masses who didn't like the movie (n.b. I did not see the movie) <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/25/0028253">read this</a> as "pirates promised a better edit of the movie".<br />  </li> </ol> Say one thing ("bad rip" or "simultaneous release") but your audience, already primed for something else, hears what they want ("bad movie" or "integrated product").<br />
<br />Our corollary lesson is to continuously correct and level set expectations - Callisto is about a simultanous, same-day, same-hour, release of ten major Eclipse projects. Period.</div>		</p>

<div>Back in November, I blogged about how we <a href="http://eclipsewebmaster.blogspot.com/2005/11/one-step-further-from-exquisitus.html">removed the password protection</a> from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/">web-based News Portal</a> at eclipse.org. I wanted to make it easier for everyone to read and participate on the newsgroups. Well, the password is back. Actually, I'm surprised we managed to allow wide-open, passwordless, authenticationless and image-verificationless write access to our newsgroups for so long without getting bombarded with SPAM.<br />
<br />The eclipse.dsdp.mtj and eclipse.newcomers groups got heavily spammed this week, so we had no real choice but to re-implement it. For those of you using the Portal because your firewall doesn't allow you to use the NNTP server directly, have you tried connecting to news.eclipse.org directly on port 80?<br />

ONJava.com just published article by Riccardo Govoni "<a href="http://www.onjava.com/lpt/a/6620">Achieving Inversion of Control with Eclipse RCP</a>":

<blockquote>
...article will describe a simple way to introduce support for Dependency Injection into an Eclipse RCP application. To avoid polluting the Eclipse platform infrastructure and to transparently add the IoC framework on top of the RCP, we will use a combination of runtime bytecode manipulation techniques (using the ObjectWeb ASM library), Java classloading agents (using the java.lang.instrument package), and Java annotations.
</blockquote>

It is really interesting to see how bytecode manipulation is being used in <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/users.html">various Java tools</a>. If your project happens to use <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM</a> bytecode manipulation framework and missing from <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/users.html">ASM users page</a> please give us a shout.		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>I've had to set aside the Sudoku stuff for a couple of days while I did some real work. But, George Koch has been keeping busy. George sent me a Sudoku puzzle builder that he's been working on; he'd managed to make it work with my application. His algorithm is better than mine: where mine is pretty simple and doesn't do key things like guarantee that a generated puzzle has a unique solution, George's does. You can also specify difficulty of the generated puzzle. It's a great addition to the application.<br />
<br />I had already done most of the work, but I spent a few minutes making it possible for the user to select the puzzle generator they want to use when they create a new puzzle. It uses the extension-point mechanism to find puzzle generators, so you just have to drop 'generator' plug-ins into the application and everything just works. I've even set it up to handle dynamically installed plug-ins; you don't need to restart to make use of additions. This will come in very handy when I hook in the update mechanism.<br />
<br />I need to make sure that the legal aspects are properly managed before I commit the code into the repository and share it. I'll let you know when that happens so you can make use of a good puzzle generator (rather than the junk I built).</div>		</p>

<div>I am starting to prepare the press release of Callisto. By all accounts Callisto is going to be a big release and a great accomplishment for the Eclipse community. Some of the stats I have collected include:<br />
<ul>   <li>Number of commiters: 262</li>   <li>Number of projects: 10<br /> </li>   <li>Number of organizations contributing commiters: 15   (this does not include individuals unaffiliated with an organization)</li>   <li>Number of countries where commiters reside: 10   <span>(</span>

The question is can we claim that 'Callisto is the largest single release from an open source project.' Based on the lines of code, I can't seem to find a bigger open source project. Linux seems to be about 3-5 million, depending on the sources.<br />
<br />So have I missed something or is Callisto really that big?</div>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>The Eclipse community helps the Eclipse community by off loading some of the bandwidth through mirror sites. These mirrors are volunteers with limited bandwidth and disk space budgets for their altruism. Thus the Callisto project planning needed to consider their issues as well as the project-local ones.<br />
<br />For example, early in the Callisto planning process, we considered creating zip distributions of different subsets of the ten Callisto projects. In the very worst case, this would be 1,023 different subsets (all 10, then 10 x 9 projects, then 90 x 8 projects, ...) times seventeen <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/eclipse_project_plan_3_2.html">different OS/CPU combinations</a> = more than 17,000 different zip files. If each zip file is between 80 and 200 Mbs, we're talking about 1.7Tbs of files that we would be asking our mirrors to handle... We also considered a sparse-matrix version where the "most popular combinations" would be built as zips, but it was still deemed to be too burdensome on the mirrors so we returned to the update manager solution.<br />
<br />Another problem we had with our mirrors was that a corrupt eclipse.org server seeded a bogus copy of an early Callisto release candidate to the mirrors. It took the teams almost two weeks to solve this problem and during that period we were all losing faith in the mirrors (when it turned out not to be the mirrors fault at all).<br />
<br />The lesson to learn: distributing a working system is more than just putting the zip file on a server - there is a large infrastructure of people and machines that makes that distribution happen. Those people are part of the project team even if they aren't coders or even directly associated with the project.</div>		</p>

Last March, I presented a full-day hands-on <a href="https://www.cmpevents.com/SDw6/a.asp?option=G&V=3&amp;id=435672">tutorial</a> at SDWest 2006 in Santa Clara, CA. The tutorial showed how to use the Plug-in Development Environment to create a rich client application.<br /><br />The attendees, who were new to Eclipse for the most part, got to develop a simple, yet cool, application. Some of the things they learned included menus, commands/keybindings, system tray integration and, of course, <em>stupid view tricks</em>.   We ended by using the <em>Eclipse Product Export</em> wizard to create a branded RCP product.<br /><br />There was so much joy in the room the moment the attendees saw that their exported product had a custom native launcher with a custom image and name.  It had just dawned on them that what they worked on all day is not a plug-in that sits on top of the Eclipse workbench.  It was their own standalone custom product.<br /><br />If you want to try this at home, PDE now provides a cheatsheet that guides you through the process of creating, defining, testing and exporting a fully-branded rich client application. Custom launcher images included.<br /><br />You can access the cheatsheet via <strong>Help > Cheatsheets...</strong> from the top level menu of the Eclipse workbench.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6458/2639/1600/cheatsheet.jpg"><img alt="cheatsheet" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6458/2639/320/cheatsheet.jpg" border="0" /></a>		</p>

	<div class="post-contents">
		<p>
<div>Planning to distribute the Callisto Simultaneous Release using the existing Eclipse Update Manager seemed like an easy win: each project could contribute features without requiring a centralized build system. It was not an easy win.<br />
<br />First of all, the update manager had never been tested with this much code. Second, the update manager was never designed to handle this <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=132450">level of</a> <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=144015">inter-dependency</a> <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=141454">complexity</a>. And third, the update manager was not designed for multi-project cooperation in a single update site - the single site.xml file needs to be coordinated amongst all ten projects -- perhaps it would have been nice to have "include" directives in the site.xml so that each project could create its own site.xml indirectly referenced from a master site.xml ... but it is always easy to design/criticize in hindsight.<br />
<br />The point here is not to complain about the update manager, but rather to describe our third lesson learned: that writing code is only part of the story. Or to say it another way: delivering a working system is more than just writing code - in this case, delivering a working system is also about making sure the delivery mechanism works. Thanks to all the Callisto team members who did exactly that: worked hard to fix the problems and make sure the chosen delivery mechanism works. You can try it out <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/callisto/discovery.php">here</a>.</div>		</p>

<div>We've had a couple of requests from folks who want to download entire CVS snapshots for analysis.  We've made them available here: <a href="http://archive.eclipse.org/arch/">http://archive.eclipse.org/arch/</a>
<br />
<br />These snapshots are generated weekly, and the Eclipse project alone will yield you a 3 GB+ download, and require about 6 GB of disk space once uncompressed.  This archive contains every version, revision, tag, branch and comment from every commit since the beginning of Eclipse time.<br />
<br />Of course, the uncompressed result is a CVS structure of RCS-encoded files (file.ext,v) that is usable by a cvs server, or the CVS command-line utility.  If you need to analyze the Eclipse CVS repositories, this is the best way to go about it (as opposed to banging on our <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs">ViewCVS interface</a>! Don't do it! Just don't!)<br />
<br />We'll also make the raw Bugzilla databases available at some point, as folks frequently request them (and also hammer on Bugzilla one bug at a time!  Don't do it! Just don't).  Our concern here is to remove e-mail addresses and user passwords from the tables before zipping them up.</div>		</p>

<a href="http://www.openlogic.com/">OpenLogic</a> is <a href="http://www.openlogic.com/community/join.php">looking for</a> Eclipse gurus (I would presume anyone well qualified would be good, but their <a href="http://www.openlogic.com/community/faq.php">FAQ</a> hints at a strong bias for committers) to earn bounties for "resolving incidents".<br />
<br />The topic was thrashed out last month on <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/08/1750256">Slashdot</a>.  OpenLogic opted for a "points" program under the assumption that bounty hunters would rather have an option for gifts over cash because "significant others" might try to divert the cash to the kids braces rather than for an XBox.<br />
<br />Ok, so this isn't the same bounty mechanism and level of "fun-ness" that I think <a href="http://mea-bloga.blogspot.com/2006/05/eclipse-bounties_114867603433729896.html">Zx was looking for</a>, but it still an interesting business model with interesting implications to open source projects.<br />
