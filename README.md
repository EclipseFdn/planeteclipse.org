Planet Eclipse is a window into the world, work and lives of Eclipse hackers and contributors.

## Guidelines

There is no official policy, however, we (the admins) generally ask ourselves the following questions before adding a feed to Planet Eclipse.

* Is the feed written by a real person?
* Is the person an Eclipse committer, hacker or contributor?
* Is the ratio of off-topic postings not too high?
* Are the off-topic postings covered by the Planet Eclipse tag line?
* Does the feed promote a company or a commercial product?
* Does the feed add more value to Planet Eclipse and the Eclipse community than it does for the feed owner?
* Is there more than just a welcome posting?
* Does the feed contain advertisements?

## How to add your blog
1. By opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/planeteclipse.org/issues/new?template=add_blog.md)
2. By creating a pull request

The issue or pull request must include a picture (185x185), the RSS feed url for the blog and the full name of the author.

If the contributor chose to submit a pull request, this information must be added to planet/planet.ini file as follows:

~~~~
[https://blogs.eclipse.org/blog/180/feed]
name = Tanja Obradovic
picture = tanja-obradovic.jpg
~~~~

Pictures must be added to the planet/theme/authors folder.

:exclamation: **TIP:** If your blog contains other topics than Eclipse, use categories to filter the feed, e.g. ```<your blog>/category/eclipse/feed/```.
